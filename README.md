# Introduction
In this project "RBC - Customer Churn Analysis," I have performed a comprehensive analysis and created a dashboard in Power BI using the RBC dataset. The project includes the creation of Business Requirement Documents (BRD), data modeling, and the utilization of DAX functions for data analysis and visualization.

## In-Depth Project Flow

### 1. Business Requirement Document (BRD)
The BRD outlines the objectives, project scope, and detailed requirements for the RBC Customer Churn Analysis. This document serves as a blueprint for the entire project, ensuring all stakeholders are aligned and the project goals are clear.

### 2. Data Gathering
In this phase, data is collected from various sources provided by RBC. This involves extracting data relevant to customer demographics, transaction history, service usage, and churn status.

### 3. Data Cleaning/Data Transformation
Raw data often contains inconsistencies and missing values. In this step, the data is cleaned and transformed to ensure accuracy and reliability. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.

### 4. Data Modeling
Data modeling involves structuring the cleaned data into a format suitable for analysis. This step includes defining relationships between different data entities and creating a data schema that supports efficient querying.

### 5. DAX Functions
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions are used to perform calculations and aggregations on the data. These functions help in creating calculated columns, measures, and complex data models that drive the analysis.

### 6. Visualization
The final step involves creating interactive visualizations using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into customer churn patterns and trends over the years.
